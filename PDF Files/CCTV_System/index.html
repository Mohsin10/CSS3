    <p class="a">Is it possible to rid a country of crime?</p>
    <p class="a">On the face of it, it seems a daunting task. But it can be done.      Thanks is no small part to innovations in technology. The very technology that       has helped create Ceasefire's futuristic CCTV System.</p>
    <p class="a">With this system, you can keep a close eye on your home or workplace       round the clock. Which means no matter what happens or where you may be when it        happens, you'll be the first to know.</p></div><br/><br/>
    
    <span class="a">What is a CCTV System?</span>
    
    <div class="c">
    
    <div class="a">
    <p class="a">A CCTV System comprises of a DVR (Digital Video Recorder) and one or     <br/>more cameras.</p>
    <p class="a">This cutting edge system acts like an intelligence unit that reports      only to you,<br/> helping you monitor your home or work place throughout the       day.The camera<br/> spick up any action in their field of vision, display it on        a monitor and feed it into<br/> the DVR, which records and stores it for         future references.</p>
    <p class="a">With a vast range of cameras, DVRs and accessories the CCTV       surveillance<br/> system can be customised to suit your needs.</p></div>

    <p class="a">Thanks to the Ceasefire CCTV System, you will never have to worry      about<br/>leaving domestic help alone at home again. Our Dome Cameras provide a       <br/> 360 degree view, allowing you to keep an eye on every corner of your        home.<br/> You can find out if your expensive necklace was misplaced or stolen         by<br/>accessing footage recorded by the DVR. With this system, you can leave          your <br/>home confident that no one will be able to enter it without your           knowledge.</div>

    <p class="a">With our CCTV cameras you will never have to worry about what goes on      in<br/> your workplace after office hours. If there are sensitive areas that       need to be<br/>monitored constantly; our system, equipped with motion detectors       , will know<br/> what to look out for. The cameras are cost effective and can          be programmed to<br/>begin recording the second the area under surveillance           is trespassed or<br/> disturbed in any way.</p></div>

    <p class="a">With our state-of-the-art surveillance system, factory owners can     oversee<br/> thousands of people at the same time and ensure that everything runs      <br/>smoothly.Our cameras are sophisticated enough to function perfectly even in       <br/>less-than-ideal situations. Our Wide Dynamic Range Cameras, for instance,
        <br/> can automatically adjust their sensors to suit the lighting of the area         under<br/>surveillance providing you with clear images even if there is a          huge contrast in <br/>lighting, allowing you to keep a vigilant eye on every           corner of your factory</p></div>

    <span class="a">Retail Outlets</span>
    <p class="a">CCTV systems are indispensable in retail outlets where one has to       monitor a<br/> vast area and hundreds of people at once.</p>
    <p class="a">The Ceasefire CCTV System makes it possible to identify shoplifters      in large<br/> crowds. Our DVRs allow you to view footage of several cameras at       once, and<br/> zoom in to the action if necessary</p>
    <p class="a">The system's motion detectors react to any disturbance in the area      under surveillance; and the Day and Night cameras provide clear images even at      night.</p></div>

    <span class="a">Ceasefire CCTV Cameras</span></div>
    <p class="a">Ceasefire's state-of-the-art CCTV cameras have Charge-Coupled Device     (CCD) sensors that offer crystal clear images and<br/> can be mounted on walls or
      ceilings. The range of cameras is broadly divided into Bullet Cameras and Dome      Cameras.</p><br/>
    <div class="a">
    <span class="b">Bullet Cameras</span>
    <p class="a">Integrated cameras and lenses that are sealed to prevent moisture      from seeping<br/> in are referred to as Bullet Cameras. Most of these cameras       have a large <br/>viewing angle. They are also compact, which makes them        perfect for domestic<br/> and commercial properties.</p></div>

    <div class="a">
    <span class="b">Dome Cameras</span>
    <p class="a">The camera's dome-like shape is what gives it its name. The Dome      Camera's unique design makes it difficult to judge where thecamera is pointing       without<br/>close inspection. These cameras can be wall-mountedor ceiling-        mounted.</p></div>

    <p class="a">The DNR DSP chipset has various powerful functions that give superior      high resolution Day & Night images. It removes camera<br/> noise and the Sensor       provides quality images at very low luminance levels. The most advanced        technology is combined on a<br/> single DSP chipset, resulting in enhanced         surveillance images.</p>

    <p class="a">Ceasefire's DVRs are available in three variants: 4 Channel, 8      Channel and 16 Channel. Ceasefire 4 Channel DVR is suitable<br/> for smaller       shops / factories / office environment. It can hold up to 4 cameras and perform        the basic functions of recording high<br/> resolution images.</p>
    <p class="a">The 8 and 16 Channel variants are part of the HD Range. These DVRs      can store High-Definition images from up to 16 CCTVs.<br/>They are best suited       for larger or more sensitive organizations such as dark warehouses, jewellery        or white goods stores and high-security government areas.</p></div>
