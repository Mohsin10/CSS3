    <span class="a">Portable.But Powerful</span>
    
    <p class="a">A fire can start anywhere, at anytime. And in just 6 minutes, it can     turn into an uncontrollable blaze. This makes it even more<br/> important for you      to tackle the fire, before it's too late.</p>
    <p class="a">Unfortunately, tiny lanes, inaccessible roads and traffic jams all      are a setback when it comes to rushing to the rescue. Which<br/> means that by       the time the fire engine reaches the scene of the fire, it could very possibly        already be too late.</p>
    <p class="a">The need of the hour is a fire engine that can manoeuvre any road,        zip through traffic and reach the burning premises in<br/> minutes.</p>
    <p class="a">Ceasefire introduces a state-of-the-art extinguisher on wheels - The      Mobile Firefighter. Powered by the world's most<br/> revolutionary firefighting         technology: Watermist.</p>
    
    <span class="a">Watermist Technology and How it Works</span>
    
    <p class="a">Ceasefire's patented Watermist technology uses the world's oldest,        most effective fire suppressant - water, increasing its<br/>power many times          over.</p>
    <p class="a">Here's how. Ceasefire extinguishers equipped with Watermist break        water down into a fine mist. This mist is then thrown at the<br/>fire with a         great kinetic force, covering a large surface area. As soon as the mist comes          in contact with the fire, it instantly turns<br/> into steam. Enveloping the           flames, cutting down the oxygen supply and reducing the temperature to            below combustion levels.<br/>Ensuring that even the largest fire succumbs             to Watermist technology.In minutes.</p><br/>
